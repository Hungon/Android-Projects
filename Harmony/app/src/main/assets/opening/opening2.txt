It's too bad that the recognizer could not\n
recognize your sentence.\e
However, if you would like to call recognizer,\w\n
firstly you open the task table.\e
There is that button at the center of the\n
screen bottom.\e
Then, you can call the recognizer\w\n
when the recognizer's image is on top\n
as pressed twice quickly.\e
When the recognizer asks you about something,\w\n
you tell an answer to obtain a process.\e
Moreover, when you open the task table,\n
and if an indicating image is on top,\w\n
you can operate a process as pressed \n
the task table twice quickly.\e
In this view, you can change current scene.\w\n
There are main menu button, tutorial button\n
and credit-view button in the task table.\d
