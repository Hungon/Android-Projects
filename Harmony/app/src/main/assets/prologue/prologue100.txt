This world is filling with sounds of colours.\e
Listen to each sound and\n
remember those sounds.\p
When you hear either sound of those,\w\n
you should remember the sound\w\n
since the recognizer asks you about\n
what colours are.\e
If you can say a correct answer,\n
you get 100 points.\p
Eventually, when the current playback\n
position reached to the end,\w\n
the current scene transitions to\n
the result scene.\d
