You are in the prologue scene.\n
This world is filling with colours.\e
Those colours are red, blue, green,\n
yellow, white, black and so on.\e
When I said either colour, you reply\n
to the recognizer the association words\n
of that colour in the selection\n
that you selected in the main menu scene.\e
For example, when I said red,\n
you answer the association words\n
of red in the selection.\e
If you can say a correct answer,\n
you get 100 points.\e
Eventually, when the current playback\n
position reached to the end,\e
the current scene transitions to\n
the result scene.\e
If you want to check out each\n
association word in the selection,\n
there is the library in the task table.\e
When you got it, it's time to play\n
as pressed the button to start.\d
