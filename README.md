# Android-Projects
These android proojects had been made when I was an newbie to android.


<h1>1. Super Triathlon</h1>
<li>Last Update Date: 2017/01</li>
<li>Category: Action</li>
<li>Target: teenager, man</li>
<li>Language: Java</li>
<li>Tools:  Android Studio and Photoshop elements 14</li>
<p>Summary:<br>
 The action game is made up Off-Road(portrait screen), Road(portrait screen) and 
 Sea(landscape screen), combines vertical scroll and horizontal scroll.
 "I have created that action game based on past work which works on PC that I have made 
 in the school.
 I have learnt Activity cycle on Android by different orientation."
</p>

<p>Functions:
 1. Ranking<br>
 When the registered user gets into the ranking view page, the best each record are automatically      
 updated, and then the user can either check own records on the ranking or delete the register.
 “I have reduced workload of DynamoDB, Cognito and IAM by leveraging Amazon Mobile Hub
 and therefore I could have implemented the ranking system in a smooth way.”
 </p>
<p>2. Record<br>
 I have implemented writing(automatically), loading and deleting that use local storage.
 In the meantime, I have learnt SQLite as well.
</p>
<p>
3. Difficulty<br>
 The user can select a difficulty level (Easy, Normal and Hard) to play the game.
 There will show up different enemies by the difficulty level the user selected.
</p>
<p>
To Sum Up:<br>
 The work has been extended the features and design from the past work that runs on PC, 
 but I had to adjust behaviour in according to specification in Android.
 Besides, as an Android developer, I learned knowledge, technic and thought from Super Triathlon  
 since the process of development.

<h1>Harmony</h1>
<li>Last Update Date: 2017/01</li>
<li>Category: Music</li>
<li>Target: teenager, blind people</li>
<li>Language: Java</li>
<li>Tools:  Android Studio and Photoshop elements 14</li>
<p>Summary:<br>
 I had created Harmony in leveraging APIs which are Voice Recognition and Text-To-Speech that  
 provided by Google.
 The user can choose the BGM from 20 pieces.
 The Music game allows the user to play the game by user's voice along with a rule of style the user   
 selected, and the user scores the points.
</p>
<li>URL：https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trials.harmony</li>
<li>Language:  Android Java</li>
<li>Tools:  Android Studio, Photoshop elements 14 and WavePad Sound Editor</li>
<p>Features and Design:<br>
 1. Task Table<br>
  The design is for the blind or visually impaired.
  The purpose is, to make good the coverage to reduce time to look for a button, so the task table   
  includes each button.
  First of all, to touch the button on bottom of the screen, and then expanding each button, 
  the task table continues to rotate unless finger separate from the task table.
  When either button is on top of the task table as double-tapped, to obtain the process that depending   
  on the button.
</p>
<p>
2. Voice Recognition<br>
  Google provides Voice Recognition function.
  I have implemented the function because that API is essential to create an application that focused 
  on the blind.
  The function allows the user to enable either to transition the scene or to control each function, 
  not only playing the game.
</p>
<p>
3. Text-To-Speech<br>
  I thought the API also must be implemented to create an application for the blind and 
  visually impaired.
</p>
<p>
4. Web viewing<br>
  I made the scene to introduce contributors whose music I used for BGM.
</p>
<p>
5. Select Mode<br>
  There are styles which are Sound, Sentence and Association to play the game.<br>
  Sound:<br>
    In Prologue scene, the user remembers each sound that associated with colour, and In Play  
    scene, the user listens the sound and remembers, and makes correct answers to score the points.
</p>
<p>
Sentence:<br>
    In Play scene, the user remembers several colours that show up on the screen and then the user says 
    colours which the user remembers.
    If the user marks correct answer, gets the points.<br>
  Association:<br>
    The user remembers words that associated with colour, and In Play scene, the user makes exact  
    association words to score the points.
</p>
<p>6. Select Difficulty Level<br>
  The user can select difficulty levels which are Easy, Normal and Hard to play the game.
  The kind of colour will be changed by the level.<br>
</p>
<p>
7. Select BGM<br>
  The user can choice BGM to play the game from 20 pieces.
  All BGMs in the game are listed on ccMixter, and they all are copyright-free.
  These pieces' URL are in Credit scene.
</p>
<p>
To Sum Up:<br>
  I concerned sound, the arrangement of buttons and accessibility to focus on the blind and visually   
  impaired rather than dealing with visible design.
  I have been considering about accessibility even now.
  When the user resumes the application after a wrong action or arbitrary action, the process should   
  obtain which node? or the process would lead the user into a comfortable in a smooth way?
  I have considered about above things while creating this application and I got some tips.
  Unfortunately, I could not get opinions from the blind or visually impaired, so it has been remaining  
  issues which are accessibility and so on.
  However, I'm confident that I have got several tips for creating the future application.
